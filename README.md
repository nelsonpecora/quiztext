JavaScript parser for the QuizText format

> QuizText is markdown-inspired text-based human-readable markup language to write down quiz questions with options and right answers.

Created by [Petr Trofimov](https://github.com/ptrofimov/quiztext), this format allows people to write simple quizzes in a very easy to use way.

This repo will contain a javascript (node + client side) module you can use to parse this format into json.
